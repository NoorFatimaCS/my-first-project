My First Python Program

This is my very first Python project, created to practice the basics of Python programming such as:

Taking user input

Printing output

Using f-strings for formatting


Program Code

name = input("enter your name:")
age = input("enter your age:")
city = input("enter your city:")
hobby = input("enter your hobby:")
print(f"Hello! My name is {name}. I am {age} years old, I live in {city}, and I love {hobby}.")

Program Output

enter your name: Noor Fatima 
enter your age: 19 
enter your city: Lahore  
enter your hobby: Coding 
Hello! My name is Noor Fatima. I am 19 years old, I live in Lahore, and I love Coding.



How to Run

1. Install Python (version 3.x).


2. Save the program as myfirstprogram.py.


3. Run in terminal or command prompt:
python myfirstprogram.py

2️⃣ Age Calculator

This program calculates the age of a person based on the current year and their birth year.

🖥 Code:

current_year = int(input("Enter current year: "))
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))

age = current_year - birth_year
print("Your age is:", age)

✅ Example Output:

Enter current year: 2025
Enter your birth year: 2005
Your age is: 20


---

3️⃣ Voting Eligibility

This program checks if a person is eligible to vote based on their age.

🖥 Code:

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Not eligible to vote")

✅ Example Output:

Enter your age: 20
Eligible to vote

Enter your age: 15
Not eligible to vote

4️⃣ Favorite Movies List

This program stores the user's favorite movies in a list and displays them.

🖥 Code:

movies = []

movie1 = input("Enter your first favorite movie: ")
movie2 = input("Enter your second favorite movie: ")
movie3 = input("Enter your third favorite movie: ")

movies.append(movie1)
movies.append(movie2)
movies.append(movie3)

print("Your favorite movies are:", movies)

✅ Example Output:

Enter your first favorite movie: Inception
Enter your second favorite movie: Titanic
Enter your third favorite movie: Avatar

Your favorite movies are: ['Inception', 'Titanic', 'Avatar']

✨ These are my first Python programs created as part of my learning journey.

5️⃣ Simple Calculator


This program is a **menu-driven calculator** that performs different arithmetic operations.

🖥 Code:
```python
print("------ Simple Calculator ------")
print("1. Addition (+)")
print("2. Subtraction (-)")
print("3. Multiplication (*)")
print("4. Division (/)")
print("5. Exponent (**)")
print("6. Modulus (%)")

# Taking user input
choice = int(input("\nEnter your choice (1-6): "))
a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Performing operations
if choice == 1:
    print("Result =", a + b)
elif choice == 2:
    print("Result =", a - b)
elif choice == 3:
    print("Result =", a * b)
elif choice == 4:
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
    else:
        print("Result =", a / b)
elif choice == 5:
    print("Result =", a ** b)
elif choice == 6:
    print("Result =", a % b)
else:
    print("Invalid choice!")

✅ Example Output:

------ Simple Calculator ------
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exponent (**)
6. Modulus (%)

Enter your choice (1-6): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result = 15

✨ This project helps beginners practice using:

Input and Output in Python

If-Else conditions

Arithmetic operators

6️⃣ Data Types Example

This program demonstrates Python's basic data types and prints their types using the `type()` function.

🖥 Code:
```python
x = 10
y = 2.53
name = "noor"
coine = True

print(type(x), type(y), type(name), type(coine))

✅ Example Output:

<class 'int'> <class 'float'> <class 'str'> <class 'bool'>

📖 Explanation:

int → Integer numbers (e.g., 10)

float → Decimal numbers (e.g., 2.53)

str → Text (e.g., "noor")

bool → Boolean values (True / False)
7️⃣ Reverse Words in a String

This program takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of its words.

🖥 Code:

sentence = input("Enter your sentence: ")
words = sentence.split()
words.reverse()
result = ' '.join(words)
print(result)

✅ Example Output:

Enter your sentence: I love Python
Python love I


---

8️⃣ Second Largest Number

This program finds the second largest number from a list entered by the user.

🖥 Code:

numbers = []
for i in range(5):
    numbers.append(int(input("Enter your number: ")))
numbers.sort()
print("Second largest number:", numbers[-2])

✅ Example Output:

Enter your number: 10
Enter your number: 20
Enter your number: 4
Enter your number: 45
Enter your number: 99
Second largest number: 45


---

9️⃣ Palindrome Check

This program checks whether a given word is a palindrome (same forward and backward).

🖥 Code:

word = input("Enter your word: ")
reverse = word[::-1]
if word == reverse:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not palindrome")

✅ Example Output:

Enter your word: madam
Palindrome

Enter your word: hello
Not palindrome

🔟 Count Vowels and Consonants

This program counts the number of vowels and consonants in a sentence.

🖥 Code:

sentence = input("Enter your sentence: ")
vowels = 0
consonants = 0

for ch in sentence:
    if ch.isalpha():
        if ch.lower() in "aeiou":
            vowels += 1
        else:
            consonants += 1

print("Vowels =", vowels)
print("Consonants =", consonants)

✅ Example Output:

Enter your sentence: I love Python
Vowels = 4
Consonants = 7
