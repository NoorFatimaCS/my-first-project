My First Python Program

This is my very first Python project, created to practice the basics of Python programming such as:

Taking user input

Printing output

Using f-strings for formatting


Program Code

name = input("enter your name:")
age = input("enter your age:")
city = input("enter your city:")
hobby = input("enter your hobby:")
print(f"Hello! My name is {name}. I am {age} years old, I live in {city}, and I love {hobby}.")

Program Output

enter your name: Noor Fatima 
enter your age: 19 
enter your city: Lahore  
enter your hobby: Coding 
Hello! My name is Noor Fatima. I am 19 years old, I live in Lahore, and I love Coding.
