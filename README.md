My First Python Program

This is my very first Python project, created to practice the basics of Python programming such as:

Taking user input

Printing output

Using f-strings for formatting


Program Code

name = input("enter your name:")
age = input("enter your age:")
city = input("enter your city:")
hobby = input("enter your hobby:")
print(f"Hello! My name is {name}. I am {age} years old, I live in {city}, and I love {hobby}.")

Program Output

(Coming soon...)

How to Run

1. Install Python (version 3.x).


2. Save the program as myfirstprogram.py.


3. Run in terminal or command prompt:
